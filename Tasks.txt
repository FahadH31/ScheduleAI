Current To Do:
- Refresh token to avoid failed calendar calls after logged in for extended period of time.
- Mobile styling support.
- Smooth sign-in/authentication process. Less clicks and reauthentication (and publish app).
- Deploy.

Future Potential:
- Support for tasks.
- Support for calendars other than primary.
- Option for voice input.

Limitations:
- Can only create/update one event a time.
- There is a limit on the number of events the AI has access to at any given time (20).
- Only deletes/updates future events.
