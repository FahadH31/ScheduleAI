Future To Do:
- on clear chat, clear the actual chat that OpenAI has too.
- Refresh token to avoid failed calendar calls after logged in for extended period of time.
- Support for calendars other than primary.
- Retrieve and automatically use the user's timezone (hardcoded to EST right now).
- Support for tasks API.
- try gpt 4.1 or wtv was being recommended in that one linkedin post

- Publish Google Project/App.
- Deploy.


Limitations:
- There is a limit on the number of events the AI has access to at any given time (20).
- Only deletes/updates future events.
- The actual "CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE" functions do not see the AI's In-Chat Response. 
So the user must specify what they want to schedule. 
- mistakes are made in understanding the user input and accurately representing it in the actual event
