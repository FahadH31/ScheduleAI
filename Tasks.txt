Fix Bug:
- Deleting Event Bug:
Seems to only happen (sometimes) to events not created during the current session/auth. 
For example if I log out and back in. Doesn't occur if I create an event straight from the GC app.
Doesn't happen with updates.

- Delete recurring events in one command.

- Store chat history in session storage.

- Smooth sign-in/authentication process. Less clicks and reauthentication.

- Add conversation history in backend openai chat.

- Control event colors.

- Voice input.


Future Potential:
- Support for tasks
- Support for calendars other than primary

Limitations:
- Need to make calendar public to display it in the IFrame.
    - Perhaps a workaround can be found (ex. open the user's calendar in a popup)
