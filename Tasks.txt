- Only reload iframe on backend action completion.

- Store chat history in session storage.

- Smooth sign-in/authentication process. Less clicks and reauthentication.

- Add conversation history in backend openai chat.

- Voice input.

- Mobile Styling Support


Future Potential:
- Support for tasks
- Support for calendars other than primary

Limitations:
- Need to make calendar public to display it in the IFrame.
    - Perhaps a workaround can be found (ex. open the user's calendar in a popup)
- Only create/update one event a time.
