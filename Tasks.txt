Future To Do:
- Refresh token to avoid failed calendar calls after logged in for extended period of time.
- On clear chat, clear the actual chat that OpenAI has too.
- Support for tasks API.
- Try different GPT version (4.1/ option for more deterministic responses)
- Support for non-primary calendars.
- Publish Google Project/App.
- Deploy.


Limitations:
- There is a limit on the number of events the AI has access to at any given time (20).
- Only deletes/updates future events.
- can't batch different commands together in 1 message (ex. create this and update that)
- The actual "CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE" functions do not see the AI's In-Chat Response. So the user must specify what they want to schedule. 
- Mistakes are made in understanding the user input and accurately representing it in the actual event
