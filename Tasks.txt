Future To Do:
- Voice input option.

- Conditionally reload - not on "OTHER"
- Refresh token to avoid failed calendar calls after logged in for extended period of time.

- Support for calendars other than primary.
- Allow the user to select time-zone.
- Support for tasks API.

- Publish Google Project/App.
- Deploy.


Limitations:
- There is a limit on the number of events the AI has access to at any given time (20).
- Only deletes/updates future events.
- The actual "CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE" functions do not see the AI's In-Chat Response. 
So the user must specify what they want to schedule. 
- mistakes are made in understanding the user input and accurately representing it in the actual event
